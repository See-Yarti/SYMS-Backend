1️⃣ Rate Limiting & Brute Force Protection
✅ Have you implemented rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks?
✅ Are you tracking failed login attempts per IP address and email separately?
✅ If a user fails multiple login attempts, do you temporarily block their account or introduce a cooldown period?

2️⃣ Session Management & Token Security
✅ Are you rotating session tokens after login to prevent session fixation attacks?
✅ When a user logs out, do you invalidate their session token immediately?
✅ If a user logs in from another device, do you log out the previous session or allow multiple sessions?

3️⃣ Monitoring & User Notifications
✅ If a user logs in from a new device or location, do you notify them via email?
✅ Have you implemented last login tracking to detect unusual activity?
✅ If a user changes their password frequently, do you send them a warning or require additional verification?

4️⃣ Forgot Password Security
✅ If a user requests a password reset link multiple times, do you allow it, update the existing token, or block it?
✅ Are password reset tokens single-use only?
✅ Have you implemented an expiration time for password reset links (e.g., 15 minutes)?

5️⃣ Logging & Auditing
✅ Are you logging failed login attempts and successful logins for security analysis?
✅ Do you store logs of password changes, account recovery attempts, and login locations?
